1. a v b v c v d v e v f v g
2. not a
therefore: b v c v d v e v f v g

0,17,posted_in_thread,"Unfortunately no, if you submit it tommorow it would be subject to the standard late penalty"

0,35,posted_in_thread,"Yes, the Rules, Schemes, Facts, and Queries Tokens are case sensitive"
0,36,posted_in_thread,"For a more specific answer, and FSM CAN count the number of occurrences of a specific character. 

You would ""announce"" a newline character each time you saw one. However an FSA cannot.

This is more of a hack but it useful and has some real applications.

There is something called a Pushdown Automaton. It contains a Stack in addition to the state machine. That would represent a more general and powerful machine. The topic is not covered in this class but is in cs 252."
0,37,posted_in_thread,You are always safe to delete whitespace if you have handled all the tokens before the whitespace
0,38,posted_in_thread,"Your program will output an error message 

Details on what the message looks like are on LS ->  Content -> Projects -> Project 1"
0,39,posted_in_thread,Yes
0,40,posted_in_thread,Up to you on this one. I put a lot of the simple FSA's into one file.
0,41,posted_in_thread,"2 options:
1
```
Use your diagram to encode the ID FSA to exclude RULES, FACTS, QUERIES, and SCHEMES as IDs
```
2
```
Add a condition in somewhere where if the ID FSA and the FACTS, SCHEMES, RULES, or QUERIES FSA both announce that they accept preference the keyword FSA
```"
0,42,posted_in_thread,For anyone experiencing a similar issue make sure that you are in the same directory as the code when you run the commands as well
0,43,posted_in_thread,Yes you are good to just pull the change and commit like usuaul
0,44,posted_in_thread,The notebook is providing code for parallel and max
0,45,posted_in_thread,A newline character does not make a string undefined
0,46,posted_in_thread,Yes that is outdated

0,48,replied_to,"So，I just saw this message, can I still submit in learning suite and show the TA the time I submitted to receive full credit?"
0,49,replied_to,Have you tested using pytest?
0,50,replied_to,"Github is setup for submissions, you will need to do a bit of digging to figure out why it failed. Check the actions tab to see which tests passed/failed.

Also make sure when you test locally you used the provided test.py file and pytest"
0,51,posted_in_thread,Looks like a runtime exception
0,52,posted_in_thread,It will be used in project 3 so I reccomend putting it in it's own file
0,53,posted_in_thread,"The message is indicating that the object of type ""str"" does not have the method to_string"
0,54,posted_in_thread,How is it different
0,55,posted_in_thread,"Yeah, sorry"

Also cc prof. Goodrich so we can get things sorted"
0,61,replied_to,yes

0,65,replied_to,<@534453897956163604> what are your thoughts on this?
0,66,replied_to,If a rule depends on itself it should be run using the fixed point style
0,67,posted_in_thread,"Deliberately throw an error the same way we did you the add_tuple function 

Example:
```

0,68,posted_in_thread,"You will need to inspect the code and determine if the relations you create make sense. Each test does include cases where I expect your code to error, those are marked by the ""try-except"" blocks"
0,69,posted_in_thread,the answer file is correct
0,70,posted_in_thread,"What is the command you are using to run pytest, those sound like unrelated, seperate problems"
0,71,posted_in_thread,"A row should contain a list of strings

A header should contain a list of strings

A Predicate has 2  fields, a name and a list of parameters

You should have a way to convert a 'scheme' Predicate into a relation

A 'fact' Predicate will become a row

A Query Predicate will be evaluated and use one of the relations from the database into a new relation using select, project, and rename"
0,72,posted_in_thread,Excellent summary
0,73,posted_in_thread,Which case is it failing? Which token? Which function is failing?
0,74,posted_in_thread,"```
relation_refrence = self.database[predicate.name]
# the above code would make a refrence, any changes to it would be changing the database as well (which is bad)

relation_copy = copy.deepcopy(self.database[predicate.name])

#this would make a copy of the relation, any changes would NOT impact the original database

#remember to add 'import copy' to the top of the file
```"
0,75,posted_in_thread,You will need to manually do the operations and compare the output to make sure that they match
0,76,posted_in_thread,Yup
0,77,posted_in_thread,Moving stuff here
0,78,posted_in_channel,"I will be holding project4 review sessions next week at the following times:

0,79,replied_to,seems like a reflexive reaction
0,80,replied_to,"Yes, that is one of the listed assumptions on learningsuite"
0,81,replied_to,"nope, so long as it passed"
0,82,replied_to,Can we turn in 5a multiple times on learningsuite?
0,83,replied_to,I thought this was in the room where class normally is but I guess not. Where are the help sessions?
0,84,replied_to,"yes, I didn't bring my charger and couldn't record todays session, I will record post tuesdays session"
0,85,posted_in_thread,What header are you using for your output
0,86,posted_in_thread,Have you run into a case where that happens?
0,87,posted_in_thread,Are you printing the tuples are you add them?
0,88,posted_in_thread,I would suggest moving the code to print out the unique tuples to evaluate rule function. This is a good approach since the function will be reused in project 5 and we expect it to produce the same output.
0,89,posted_in_thread,You may find the set difference operation to be helpful
0,90,posted_in_thread,Pass through one of the tests that's failing by hand
0,91,posted_in_channel,"Some things to be aware of:

There will not be a lab session for this project, and you must complete it in 2 parts.

5a is entirely written. After finishing it you may turn it in on learningsuite. If you want more immediate feedback, come into the TA lab to get it graded by hand. You can do this as many times as needed to get full credit.

5b is writing code to perform the same computation. This project will not be accepted late, becuase it is due the last day of classes. If you do not get it turned in on or before the due date you will not get credit."
0,92,replied_to,It should be fine
0,93,replied_to,Is that supposed to say ```if scc not is self dependent?```
0,94,replied_to,"I'm on til 12, I cannot check your work but I can help clarify if you have the right idea or approach"
0,95,replied_to,Wouldn’t any SCC of size 1 be self dependent?
0,96,replied_to,"25 points per question, standard late\early policy"
0,97,replied_to,"9, becuse there are 9 rules and our graph should show the dependancies between the rules"
0,98,replied_to,Recursion is the recommended approach
0,99,replied_to,"Do late points count the same for project 5a (2 points per day), or is Friday night a hard deadline like for homework?"
0,100,replied_to,"Correct, the A stands for acyclic meaning no cycles"
0,101,replied_to,"This is mentioned in the specs, there in general run the fixed point algorithm till no more tuples are added.

There is one edge case for some sccs of size 1 (these should only be read once) review the specs then come back if you still have questions"
0,102,replied_to,Can you guys pin this message.
0,103,posted_in_thread,I'd suggest consulting the specs again. This particular edge case is addressed in there repeatedly
0,104,posted_in_thread,I think the largest scc is like size 10 in the cases
0,105,posted_in_channel,Exam format
0,106,replied_to,Will do!
0,107,posted_in_thread,You may look at your notes when working on the prep exam.

1: all attributes match (perform an intersection)

2: no attributes match (perform a cross product)

3: some attributes match (perform a cross product on tuples preserving the context of the matching attributes)"
0,114,posted_in_thread,"Y blue, X yellow"
0,115,posted_in_thread,I think I updated the question to be more clear
0,116,posted_in_thread,You need to show all possible options for the states of the premises
0,117,posted_in_thread,"The second, you need to prove that no matter what values of P and Q the statment is true."
0,118,posted_in_thread,the first set would just be {A} becuase it is the the only possible first terminal symbol produced by <a>
0,119,posted_in_thread,For hw8 the grammar is in the project 2 description
0,120,posted_in_thread,It is a topic of some contention. We will give full credit either way

80,160,replied_to,"I don't know if you ever got this fixed, but I think I fixed it by adding a + ""\n"" to the end of my final output string. If you go in and look at the provided answers you'll see that there's an infernal extra space below every one."
80,8,replied_to,"If a function has elements in its domain that are unmapped it would still be a function (assuming no inputs lead to 2+ outputs). I think that makes it a partial function. Injective doesn't have anything to do with all the domain elements being mapped so it is still injective. Injective just says that for the inputs that are mapped, if the inputs are unique then their outputs should also be unique."

7,166,posted_in_thread,I think I can see where the problem is. It is where I am declaring my function
7,167,replied_to,I had that happen to me too. Basically it's just a weird way of saying that you need to make sure to print out your Domain.

Does anyone understand where G1 and G2 come from in this database relation? Is it a typo?

With the SNAP database relation the scheme was given:
snap(S, N, A, P)
so it makes sense how this Fact correlates:
snap(''67890','Lucy,'34 Pear Ave','555-5678')

My question is with CSG. The Scheme is:
csg(C, S, G1, G2).
But the Facts don't correlate.
csg('CS 101','12345','A')
csg('EE 200','33333','B')

Is this a typo or am i missing something? Shouldn't there only be one attribute, G, instead of G1 and G2 since in the facts it was given as only 1?"

176,47,posted_in_channel,Yeah that's correct
84,29,posted_in_channel,has anyone else ran into the problem of the while loop in the run function not looping past the first created token?
84,102,replied_to,This is probably what your gonna have to do.
84,62,replied_to,"Where does it say, if its raining Yvette will get wet? from what I can see there aren't any imply ones on that proof"
84,254,replied_to,i though that too but there arent. The first test case of nothing passes so its not doing it for that but this is what happens on the second test case
84,111,replied_to,"Yes, I just set that value to the token list size + 1 (or -1 if it's too big)"
84,66,replied_to,You also need to be careful because you can't just read in a 2nd apostrophe and then call it quits. In the code we're reading they use two apostrophes inside a string to denote an apostrophe. For example if they wanted the string to be Alex's toy they would have 'Alex''s toy' so you have to check the next character to make sure it's not a second apostrophe in a row
84,255,replied_to,are you running it through project1.py
84,253,posted_in_thread,i tried that but it keep giving me errors
84,182,posted_in_thread,"i had to put python -m in front for it to work, it might be a windows thing"
84,256,posted_in_thread,"it is printing it, the line is updating within the run function its just when i use self.line_number in my manager function to create the right token, its not using the updated value"
84,47,posted_in_channel,my bucket 80 test case 4 is working properly when I run that specific file but when use the test cases in the pass off it is outputting something different. Any Ideas? All the other test cases work
84,257,replied_to,"I dont think so, it seems like project 3 is going to utilize each individual data structure to interpret the datalog program"
84,59,replied_to,Your lexer in project 1 printed out the token list most likely using a to_string() to do it. In project 2 you want to make sure you are just passing in the list of tokens as a list of token objects. You may have to manipulate your project 1 code a bit
84,258,replied_to,i would try just setting curr_predicate.name to an empty string and curr_predicate.parameters to an empty list. Thats what I did and it worked well. my guess is there is a problem in you clearcurrentpredicate function where it is somehow connected to your datalogprogram object
84,259,posted_in_thread,idk if you already figured it out but if you specify the variable type as a parameter it should work. Something like my_parameter: Parameter = Parameter() Then you can access those objects variables with the .(whatever the variable name is)
84,260,posted_in_thread,where are you putting each token into that tokens list?
84,261,posted_in_thread,"The parse_datalog_program function shouldn't return anything, if you do option A on the TA help slides which i highly recommend. It just wont fail if its an accepted format.  If you do option B it should just return your datalog_program object. The datalog_program object contains all of your scheme predicates, fact predicates, rules, query predicates, and domain list. your datalog_program.to_string() returns a formatted version of all of these put together so that it looks like what is supposed to be outputed from the lab specs and answer.txt files."
84,54,posted_in_thread,"<Person> was able to figure it out for me. He just had me git push it and then he went in and figured out why it was failing when it was for the pytest but not for the specific file. I'm not sure what he did, but i have the green checkmark on github now"
84,58,posted_in_channel,"why would it say that the str doesnt have a name attribute when I do scheme.name? my scheme predicates is a list of predicates so each one should have a name attribute. Also, when i do scheme. it comes up with the options of name and attribute its just the compiler that doesnt like it"
84,262,posted_in_thread,no
84,72,posted_in_thread,when i try to iterate through self.database it says that database isnt iterable
84,263,posted_in_thread,how would you get the name and parameters of the predicate separate though?
84,12,replied_to,I ended up making a tree class and Node class because that's what makes sense to me. So my Forest is a list of trees and my tree object has its own list of nodes and postorder list.
84,78,posted_in_channel,Is there going to be a recording of the project 4 overview posted?
84,3,replied_to,Sometimes it gives that error when you run you code from anywhere except project4.py and your main function.
84,264,posted_in_thread,I also had that problem because my number of added tuples wasn't being set to zero at the beginning of every loop of the fixed point algorithm.  If it isn't set back to zero it has no way of stopping.
84,91,posted_in_channel,Yup
84,226,replied_to,I had a get_scc function which took in a list of rules and the strongly connected components. I iterated through the rules and scc and returned a list of rules which I then did my fixed point algorithm on.

84,268,posted_in_thread,"I was able to get it fixed. I just had to double check how my num_rounds variable was getting updated and make sure that if the scc  only had one rule in it and that rule didnt depend on itelf, then it only gets evaluated once and doesnt run through the fixed point algorithim"
84,269,posted_in_thread,Did you try directing the output into a separate file and running a difference command on that file and the answer file?
84,270,posted_in_thread,"For every rule in your datalog program(original_rule), you look at the body predicates in each rule. Then you have another loop through your rules to get the head predicates(other_rule). If the original_rules body predicates name  is the same as your other_rules head predicate name, that means that there is an edge from  your original rules node to your other_rules node. Therefore you add your other_rules node to the dependency list of your original rules node"

169,58,posted_in_channel,"Hey for anyone who is having trouble with key word arguments, or bugs that seem to be super random, this is from ChatGPT:

```
The behavior of mutable default arguments being shared across instances is a result of how Python handles function and method definitions. When you define a method with a default mutable argument, such as a set, list, or dictionary, Python evaluates the default argument only once at the time of function definition. This default value is then used for all calls to the method if no value is explicitly provided when the method is called.

Let's break down the key aspects of why this behavior occurs:

Function Definition Evaluation: When you define a class and its methods, the default arguments are evaluated and bound at the time of function definition, not each time the function is called.

Mutable Default Argument: In the case of a mutable default argument like an empty set (set()), that mutable object (the set) is created only once at the time of the class definition.

Shared Across Instances: Since the default argument is created only once, it becomes a shared reference across all instances of the class. Any instance that does not explicitly specify a different value for that argument will use the same shared default object.

Here's a simplified example to illustrate the behavior:
```
```python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, my_set=set()):
        self.my_set = my_set

obj1 = MyClass()
obj2 = MyClass()

obj1.my_set.add(1)

print(obj1.my_set)  # Output: {1}
print(obj2.my_set)  # Output: {1}
```
```
To avoid this shared behavior you should follow the recommended practice of using None as the default value and creating a new mutable object (e.g., a set) inside the constructor if the argument is not explicitly provided. This ensures that each instance gets its own separate mutable object:
```
```python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, my_set=None):
        if my_set is None:
            my_set = set()
        self.my_set = my_set
```"
169,78,posted_in_channel,"For everyone starting project 4, please delete this line in Relation.py if you have it: 
```python
name = ""\u03C0"" + ""_{"" + "","".join(column_headers) + ""}("" + self.name + "")""
```
And replace it with:

```python 
name = self.name # or name = """" it doesn't really matter""
```
This will make your code significantly faster and won't cause you to elapse the time limit"
169,160,replied_to,My code ran under a second when I rewrote it over the summer. We just have a high time limit so something will have to be very wrong to break that

8,10,replied_to,"That's biconditional and it is only True when the items on the left and right have the SAME truth values, either True-True or False-False"
8,160,replied_to,I heard yes
8,328,replied_to,"DId you do all these before following the learning suite pass off instructions?
git add .
git commit -m “Message”
git push"
8,159,replied_to,"I got that error when I hadn’t done the git add and push stuff before running the cases on GitHub.

DId you do all these?
git add .
git commit -m “Message”
git push"
8,329,replied_to,"Nah, if GitHub says you passed all the tests you’re good"
8,60,replied_to,"yeah I did something like that. For python sets there's a difference function built in that you can use with '-'

set_A - set_B = New set that contains stuff only in A"
8,330,replied_to,"If you look at the test.py folder it just contains a few functions, no function calls. For testing, I would go edit project1.py as necessary then run that. Once that works I think you can do pytest test.py -v -vv —bucket=20"
8,111,replied_to,I think callables is just an alias. It shouldn't matter
8,226,replied_to,"looking at my code it seems like my sccs were already in the right order. Basically, for every scc do your fixed point algorithm with the rules in the specific scc. And don't forget the case for running the fixed point algorithm if a rule is self dependent"
8,161,replied_to,"I don't know if it's a kosher strategy, but I only had the id accept once it saw a terminating character. I compensated by adding all but the last character into the token."
8,95,replied_to,"Just in general, p->q is only false in one circumstance: when p is true and q is false.

Looking at the 2nd table in the last row, both p & q are false. Since they are both the ‘p’ in ‘p->q’ it’s impossible for you to get the case of the first thing being true but then second being false. So, p->r and q->r are both true"
8,331,posted_in_thread,and you originally downloaded the project from github classroom?
8,332,posted_in_thread,Error message?
8,333,posted_in_thread,Create an object for every one of the classes by calling its constructor. Ex: class Colon is made with Colon(parameters)
8,334,posted_in_thread,"No, they should inherit from a generic FSA class. Tokens are separate"
8,335,posted_in_thread,"but, you can't just remove all the whitespace at once? EX: A string/comment has whitespace in it"
8,336,posted_in_thread,interesting idea. I'll try something like that. It always just feels like I have to do the weirdest thing to get the FSAs to do what I want
8,218,posted_in_thread,"Ok, just want to check if I have the logic right: lex passes one line of the input into all of the FSAs. The manager function determines which token to create based on the True/False list. It takes the FSA object that belongs to the token it creates and sees how many characters it read. This amount of characters can then be removed from the input_string and lex is run again with this smaller string"
8,44,posted_in_thread,Thanks for the clarification. This is the FSA directory within the jupyter notebook directory. Are you able to identify which files are for the peek and patch method?
8,45,posted_in_thread,Then how do you know if a string is undefined??
8,337,posted_in_thread,"Hmmm, did you already get the Jupiter notebooks downloaded onto your computer in a folder? I think that was part of project0 or some set up thug"
8,47,posted_in_channel,When will the project 2 code be ready to download from GitHub classroom?
8,12,replied_to,The id/string part is also helpful for project 3 I think so you still want it implemented
8,96,replied_to,Yeah I don’t think it should be taking that long. You’re probably doing unnecessary stuff somewhere or at the wrong time
8,62,replied_to,Did you use this for your datalog parser function?
8,101,replied_to,"yeah, it's all the stuff in facts. Just make sure to alphabetize also"
8,292,replied_to,"It says to do a DFS search starting at A. You can start anywhere, but your forest will look different depending on where you start"
8,50,replied_to,I submitted a few days ago and had no issues. Did you make sure to git add first?
8,338,replied_to,All it is is the strings inside the facts. One you have your facts in a list in the datalog class it is easy to grab them
8,9,replied_to,"I think some of the first/follow sets might even be on the slides. They're all really small, many have only one item and max is maybe three."
8,339,posted_in_thread,I would look at the example input and output. Look at what’s inside each of the facts and see how that relates to what’s in the domain
8,340,posted_in_thread,Let me know if you find one then
8,224,posted_in_thread,"I see. I will still need my if statements, I just won't need to nest them"
8,58,posted_in_channel,I heard yes
8,341,posted_in_thread,"Sorry for the confusion. I thought you were talking about the return string. Yeah, you need the output from project 2. You're going to pass the DatalogProgram object from project2 into your Interpreter object that you create for project3"
8,78,posted_in_channel,Any tips for optimizing the code so it’s not too slow to pass the auto grader?
8,211,replied_to,Yeah so test 6 bucket 100 is the one that will tell you if your code is efficient enough. As long as it’s within the time limit mentioned on learning suite you should be good. How long?
8,100,replied_to,Even test 6 bucket 100 goes fast?
8,86,posted_in_thread,Hmmm I think I already do method 2. It’s test 6 in the 100 bucket
8,200,posted_in_thread,"I think you're on the right track, though I would think you would check if the whole row was in master.rows, rather than row.values"
8,91,posted_in_channel,How should we implement a tree or forest? Are they all just lists?
8,83,replied_to,you never need to keep track of preorder in 5. Only postorder
8,105,posted_in_channel,I asked a few classes ago. He said they are online
8,342,replied_to,No. You submit it on the midterm so they’re definitely not going to provide a key
8,110,posted_in_channel,Is there a specific file type the picture of the homework should be? Is heic ok?
8,343,replied_to,The goal for problem two is to try to make two different parse trees that ultimately create the same sequence of terminals. Just play around and see if you can get the same thing two ways. It doesn’t matter what that thing is so long as it’s composed of terminals
8,94,replied_to,"From my knowledge a directed or an undirected graph can be simple. But (a,b) indicates that it starts at a and ends at b (directed), while {a,b} is like a set which has no order (undirected)"
8,344,replied_to,I think what he officially said is that if you attempt the problems you will get credit
8,345,replied_to,"I think this same typo still needs to be fixed: It was fixed on question 23 but not in the prompt above everything, it still says ""¬(p v q)"". And I was wondering why I was able to prove false 🤦‍♂️"
8,163,replied_to,Pretty sure it’s left to right. I think right to left applies to only the unary operations (operations that act on only one set)
8,6,replied_to,"Yes, here we have two tables/relations, student & whomajor. Yes, each fact adds a row to the table student. Not sure about rules since that’s project 4. A query always returns a new relation/table. If I understand you correctly about the last question, yes, if you specify a specific string for a column then your resulting table will not include that column. It will only include the columns that had variables in them. For example, whomajor(‘Roosevelt’,N) will return a new relation with only the column M (renamed N I think)"
8,79,replied_to,"I’m not looking at the problem, but I believe you can negate it. Just look at the de morgan for quantifiers"
8,346,replied_to,Scroll up a few messages
8,113,posted_in_thread,"A join is always possible. If all the columns are the same it is like an intersection, if none are in common it is a cross product, if some are similar then it is somewhere in between"
8,303,posted_in_thread,You mean universal generalization?
8,347,posted_in_thread,"Yeah, the first and follow sets are quite small and fairly straight forward. If you want you can dm your answers and i can compare with mine since I’m fairly confident I have them"
8,241,posted_in_thread,where is it in the grammar? Is it represented by one of the letters?
8,304,posted_in_thread,"I just assumed that the vocab included absolutely everything. For example, from one state I might have two arrows to two differrent states. For one the input might be a specific thing like \n, and the other one might just be ""All else"", referring to literally any other individual character on a keyword. That was my assumption on what they wanted anyway"
8,136,posted_in_channel,Has anyone gotten this error? I'm thinking it's because there's nothing named Project 0 Works in the folder given but the instructions say to put that in
8,321,posted_in_thread,What changes did you make to the project0.py file?
8,144,posted_in_thread,"cool, I figured it out"
9,1,posted_in_channel,Do we have to download GitHub or is that all in the project 0 instructions?
9,47,posted_in_channel,Does anyone know how I put in the first and follow sets of the grammar we are using?(ie what the sets are for it/how to figure out what they are easily) or if we actually have to manually put them in in the first place? I’ve started trying to put in the first sets for it but am unsure if it is correct or not. I’ve used the notebook example code of the parser as the outline of my parser class.
9,58,posted_in_channel,"Do we need a database class in the project, it is kinda unclear in the specs and slides?"
9,136,posted_in_channel,Does anyone have any advice with getting GitHub for this?I have never used it before so I’m. It quite sure of all the detail of what to do
9,348,replied_to,"It's in Talmage 1062, but according to the TA schedule, today is help online only until noon"
9,102,replied_to,Same.
159,29,posted_in_channel,I keep getting this error when i push to github but my output and the answer files are identical in a difference checker
159,47,posted_in_channel,for some reason my datalog program class seems to be taking in my list of schemes (etc) as a list that contains a list. I think I can work with it for now but I am not sure that it is ideal for future projects. Has anyone had a similar thing happen?
159,86,posted_in_thread,what would be an alternative to this?
215,29,posted_in_channel,"Hello! I've gotten everything working for this project (I got an extension from Professor Goodrich), and ran the tests on my local machine. I committed everything to github, but nothing shows up in the Actions tab. I can't find any more info on this. Have I done something wrong?"
215,331,posted_in_thread,"Yeah, I changed the location on my personal computer at one point but using git init synced it up again"
349,102,replied_to,"I would have to see images of what you mean. Also, by pushed to repo, do you mean you did [git add .] -> [git commit -m ‘Name’] -> [git push]?"
349,29,posted_in_channel,I pushed my code to my project1 repo but I do not see any actions to autograde. What am I missing? (I already passed all pytests locally)
81,1,posted_in_channel,"Content -> Lectures: Reading, Topics, Slides -> each class has a reading listed"
81,83,replied_to,I believe you're right. I don't think it's a big deal as long as you label the axes
81,101,replied_to,"Content -> Lectures: Reading, Topics, Slides -> each class has a reading listed"
81,29,posted_in_channel,"I have a FSA class for every token except for UNDEFINED and EOF, which I just handle in the lexer. Is this allowed?"
81,350,posted_in_thread,Python thinks its funny to rename some methods without telling you
81,47,posted_in_channel,"Check pinned messages, the starter code and video are a good start"
81,259,posted_in_thread,"in python, self is included in the parameters of a method, but not used when calling that method"
81,340,posted_in_thread,I haven't submitted yet but I would imagine your project 1 files need to be in your project 2 repo for the auto grader to work
81,78,posted_in_channel,i had my project autograded yesterday but today I pushed some small changes to my code just to add some type hints. Should I run it through the autograder again or am I fine?
81,12,replied_to,Oh gotcha. I am putting it in my Relation class. Do you think that is a bad call? I am debating between that and the Interpreter class becuase it changes the database
81,91,posted_in_channel,are we allowed to use defaultdict from collections
81,351,replied_to,"this should help:

81,268,posted_in_thread,I am having this exact issue
81,105,posted_in_channel,LS says the midterm opens the 24th and closes the 27th
81,352,posted_in_thread,S = E means the starting nonterminal is E
81,110,posted_in_channel,"you can find the follow set for a nonterminal by looking at a production where the nonterminal youre trying to find the follow set for is part of the right hand side of the production (like the production for datalogProgram)
then if you can satisfy ωAtη where A is your nonterminal, ω is the stuff before, and η is the stuff after, then t is part of the follow set"
81,66,replied_to,Same. Does it just want us to add edges like from D to A (Which isn't in the forest because A was already visited)?
81,81,replied_to,but this makes it sound like resolution is a category? idk
81,189,replied_to,I mean Disjuctive Syllogism is just a fancy form of Resolution...
81,59,replied_to,just the one terminal that immediately follows the nonterminal
81,353,posted_in_thread,thanks!
81,136,posted_in_channel,I am having a similar issue
81,324,replied_to,I am having a similar issue
354,1,posted_in_channel,"quick question about what the end of the semester will look like, is there a final exam? or is our project the final part of the semester?"
354,3,replied_to,you have to go into jetbrains and submit for a student license
354,14,posted_in_thread,is the final going to be online during finals week?
354,47,posted_in_channel,if someone could help me please my test cases are misbehaving

83,23,posted_in_thread,Thanks!
83,29,posted_in_channel,Did you get this resolved? I'm having the same problem. Alternative general question: is it fine to just download the starter code as a .zip instead of cloning it via the terminal?
83,355,replied_to,Did you get this resolved? I'm having the same problem. Alternative general question: is it fine to just download the starter code as a .zip instead of cloning it via the terminal?
83,32,posted_in_thread,How do you differentiate something like Ruless (an ID) from Rules: (a keyword and a colon)?
83,356,posted_in_thread,That worked! Thanks
83,47,posted_in_channel,I got it. It's alphabetical. Thanks!
83,60,replied_to,I got it. It's alphabetical. Thanks!
83,58,posted_in_channel,Is the autograder up yet? I've pushed to Github but it says there are no workflows
83,230,posted_in_thread,"I think so. I did git add, then git commit -m then git push"
83,357,replied_to,In the TA lab
83,78,posted_in_channel,I thought this was in the room where class normally is but I guess not. Where are the help sessions?
83,91,posted_in_channel,"Do we just ignore preorder in project 5a? I.e. the first thing popped from the stack will have postorder 1, not more than one?"
226,29,posted_in_channel,I'm also confused about the structure of the project.  What are lexer.run() and lexer.lex() supposed to do?  Also how are we supposed to keep track of how much input we have read?
226,3,replied_to,"Mine just returns a string containing the type, value, and line number formatted to look like the output from the examples.  It's only like 1 line.  Then you can call print(token.to_string()) to print any token"
226,358,posted_in_thread,"Figured it out, it was because my files somehow got moved around.  If anyone else has this issue make sure all the files for pytest are in the project1 directory, they got moved into my classes directory somehow"
226,47,posted_in_channel,"So I thought I did everything the exact same as the TA video, but no matter what I feed in as the token list it outputs success?  Anybody else run into this before?"
226,58,posted_in_channel,Do I need to modify my project 2 code to output something specific?  I didn't see anything about that on the lab spec
226,78,posted_in_channel,"I'm confused on how to get the rule output right for the rules, because apprently the output is different than for the queries.  Do I need to create a separate evaluate predicate function just for rules?"
226,91,posted_in_channel,"My program is finding SCC's now, how did you guys make the rules get evaluated in the right order?  I'm guessing I should change the interpret_rules() function since it currently just loops through every rule.  Just wondering how other people approached it before I start it."
226,110,posted_in_channel,"For hw 4 question 3 is it ok if we define our own sets?  For example can I say A is the set of all possible inputs, or T is the set of all tokens?"
226,66,replied_to,"This is what I did as well, the format kind of makes it seem like they are terminals as well since they are lowercase"
226,359,posted_in_thread,I'm pretty sure you do so that it exactly matches the format in the instructions
13,1,posted_in_channel,"Just to make sure I'm not missing something. For the projects, we don't submit anything on learning suite. We just push our changes until the checks are passed?"
13,29,posted_in_channel,how did you determine a token was :- and not : ?
13,101,replied_to,how did you determine a token was :- and not : ?

13,152,posted_in_thread,What exactly goes on during said hackathon?
206,1,posted_in_channel,It works fine for me ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
206,191,posted_in_thread,No problem!
206,47,posted_in_channel,I'm having the same issue. My output matches the expected answer perfectly but I still fail the test with this message
206,58,posted_in_channel,"The output of the interpreter as a string. An example from the project info page:

206,91,posted_in_channel,"Since running running a DFS and retrieving the postorder from it requires a stack, I found recursion was the easiest way to go about it. It's relatively straightforward to do with recursion, you just call the DFS function again for every non-visited node adjacent to the current node and make sure everything is marked as visited accordingly."
206,110,posted_in_channel,"Like it says, the square root of a positive n is both n **and** -n. x^(1/2) is the same thing as sqrt(x). This means that if x is 4, f(x) is equal to 2 **and** -2. Functions can map an input only to a single output, and this equation violates that by mapping every input to both a positive and negative output."

60,3,replied_to,You shouldn't need to. Have your lexer function use the FSAs and generate tokens

344,401,posted_in_thread,"When projecting to an empty list, any rows that previously existed in the relation should still exist, they would just become empty rows. That way you can still determine if the query succeeded or not based on the number of rows in the relation."

    print(project4(input_contents))```

344,403,posted_in_thread,"Which query are you getting extras on? I’m guessing it’s either the 3rd or the last, because all of the others return every single row from their respective relations."
344,227,posted_in_thread,"Do you mean removing columns? The project method should never be removing rows.
I don't really have anything to say besides the obvious, the row length should never be different from header length. I'd recommend using some print statements or breakpoints to determine whether that discrepancy is happening before calling project or during project."
344,404,posted_in_thread,"I think colIndex is short for ‘column index’. 

The first select method, shown here, is for selecting rows where a particular column holds the given value. This is used for matching constants in queries.

The second select method is for selecting rows where two given columns hold the same value. This is used for matching duplicate variables in queries."

344,409,posted_in_thread,"You should only need 2 loops, mine looks something like this (my actual code is way messier, so this is a bit of an oversimplification):

The database class wasn’t iterable in <Person>’s original code because the Database is NOT a dictionary, it is a class that contains a dictionary.

344,412,posted_in_thread,"One of the selects chooses rows (tuples) that have a specific value at a specific index in the row. This is used for selecting rows in a relation that match constants in a query.

The other select chooses rows that have equal values at 2 specific indexes. This is used when a query contains multiple of the same variable to select rows that have the same value at both positions of that variable in the query."
344,78,posted_in_channel,"I would like to share with everyone that you can type hint inside a class to itself by putting this as the first line in the file:
```from __future__ import annotations```
If you don't know what that means, here's my brief explanation. As some of you may have discovered in project 3, Python doesn't like it when you indicate that the return type of a class method is the type of the enclosing class. For example, select, project, and rename are functions inside the Relation class that return Relation objects, but Python doesn't normally recognize ->Relation as a valid type hint inside of the Relation class definition. You can get around this by replacing the type hint with a string of the name of the type (eg. ->'Relation'), or you can just include the import statement from above."
344,413,posted_in_thread,"Personally, I stored the tuples in a set, which I used to construct a Relation. Then I could use the Relation's to_string method to output the tuples with the correct formatting later."
344,414,posted_in_thread,"You are correct, the projection step ensures that the number of columns matches in the joined relation matches the target relation, and that those columns are in the correct order. If you've followed the steps this situation should never cause a problem."
344,415,posted_in_thread,"I haven't looked at the demo code, but I'm fairly certain that's a mistake. It should be a Rule object, not a predicate object."
344,264,posted_in_thread,The first thing I would check is if the variable that tracks the number of changes made is being updated and reset correctly.
344,416,posted_in_thread,"I'm not sure about the first part, but for the second part your problem is that you are printing the parameter names from the rule instead of from the associated scheme. The rename step in rule evaluation handles this."
344,417,posted_in_thread,The best place to start here would be running each file in the 80s bucket individually to narrow down where the error occurs.

344,424,posted_in_thread,"Yes, one example is a relation with no edges (represented in matrix form by a matrix of all zeros) is simultaneously symmetric, asymmetric, and antisymmetric."

433,434,posted_in_thread,I am also confused about this...

If they could be made taller, I'm sure that would be helpful to those still fitting the test in last minute."
345,110,posted_in_channel,"This is old, but on Homework 3, question 6 has me confused. it says (a∗b∪b∗a)∗ should match any number of alternating sequences of a's and b's, but shouldn't it match any combination of a's and b's? When I look at (a∗b∪b∗a)∗ I would think that if you took the two kleene stars inside to zero you could get that everything (b∪a)∗ gives you is also valid, and from my understanding that can give you any combination of a's and b's. Is that wrong?"
345,95,replied_to,"A 2x1, yes. Like for the other problems, I don’t know if you would have a row saying “Course - CS120” for question 3 as an example. That information is redundant and is part of the problem statement (no new info is being presented). So by that logic, makes me think the same might apply to question 1?"
345,3,replied_to,So step 4 is definitely supposed to say ¬(p ∧ q) and not ¬(p v q)
59,435,replied_to,You have to make changes to the branch before you can make a pull request. Hit the new branch button and then go to that branch and add a readme file or make a slight change on github. Then you should be able to have an option that lets you make the pull request. That's what I did anyway and it worked for me

95,98,replied_to,Yeah
95,441,replied_to,"This is obvious, but I get that error if I accidentally try to run the code from that class file rather than from project1.py"
95,366,posted_in_thread,Any extra new lines at the end of the output or the test cases?
95,370,posted_in_thread,"If you’re referring to why it bugs out if you run lexer_fsm directly, I suspect it’s because the file has nothing calling it. You run the file, but there is no instantiation of Lexer_FSM(). So it doesn’t know what to do. It would be like running a Class.cpp without creating an object of type Class"
95,256,posted_in_thread,Can you send a screenshot of 1) where you call your manager function and 2) of your manager function?
95,442,posted_in_thread,"A suggestion might be to have one constructor, and give line_num a default value. So if you input a value, it’ll use the one you gave it. But if you don’t give a value, then the default value could be like “None” and then an if statement “if line_num == None” could handle it accordingly"
95,41,posted_in_thread,"I think the key to this is to remember that every line of code will make its way through each FSA. And each FSA will return to the LexerFSM whether or not that specific FSA recognizes the sequence of characters fed into it (at least if you’re following the jupyter notebooks method). 

The notebook (or maybe the project description?) clarified that we will classify a set of characters a specific token based on which FSA returns True last. So, there might be a way to arrange the order in which the FSAs are run so that the specific tokens (like Schemes, Rules, Queries, and Facts) have trump over the more general IDs…"
95,431,posted_in_thread,That serves mostly as a cosmetic device which stores some meta data. The style guide describes it as “a promise to readers of the code that this item is a function”
95,443,posted_in_thread,Your would stop when it encounters the 1 in 1stPerson. I believe the example on Learning Suit is just to illustrate that a word starting with a number cannot be a string (but everything else after could be if the number wasn’t there)
95,335,posted_in_thread,"How I did it was I called all of my FSAs in a for loop in the Lex function (as shown in jupyter notebooks). So, before I call the Lex function (which requires an input string), I scan the input to see if there is any white space which should be ignored by the Lex function (and hence the FSAs). If there is, I remove the white space by getting rid of that character. A while loop makes sure that all white space is removed"
95,336,posted_in_thread,"I did read the next character. I read it, if it wasn’t alnum() then I “backtracked” on telling the FSM how many characters to insert into the token"
95,47,posted_in_channel,Did Dr. Goodrich say after what class we’ll know everything to do Project 2? Was that after today’s lecture?
95,444,posted_in_thread,"I would use some breakpoints to watch it (sorry, really “duh” of an answer) and make sure that when you return from your recursive descent parsing, that you’re not inserting any lists into your defined list of predicates.

 For example, let self.schemes be the list in which you store all of your schemes. Let parse_scheme return a Scheme predicate, and let parse_scheme_list return a list of Scheme predicates.

Self.schemes = [parse_scheme]
self.schemes += [parse_scheme_list]

Because parse_scheme_list returns a list, self.schemes will be a list containing a list"
95,445,posted_in_thread,"So, the best practice is to use both. Within the parse function, find out if the next input value is 1) a part of the first set, and then 2) a part of the first set and then 3) if neither, throw an error. 

However, this grammar is nice enough that you could get away with just checking the first set depending on how you have your error function set up. But it’s not wise in the long run (and implementing it the correct way doesn’t take too much effort)"
95,91,posted_in_channel,Wouldn’t any SCC of size 1 be self dependent?

The y in 9d is bound to the forall quantifier, which means that it acts like a ""dummy variable"".

106,457,posted_in_thread,"Yes, you only need resolution. Remember the four forms of resolution that I shared in class. The problem you noted is one of the forms. The idea is that you can just apply resolution to complete proofs without the other rules once you have the knowledge base in the right form."

C = {1,2}
D = set()
C_cross_D = set()
for c in C:

79,47,posted_in_channel,My code works for all of the input files when I run them manually but fails all of the the bucket: '80' test in pytest locally and in github. I can't figure out why but the output seems to be different when I run pytest versus when manually set the file in `project2.py`. Has anybody else had this problem?
79,378,posted_in_thread,Yeah! Go ahead and post them here!
79,222,posted_in_thread,Here's the full thing
79,58,posted_in_channel,Can somebody tell me what exactly I need to output from my `project3` method?
79,78,posted_in_channel,"Is it required for the relational operator methods to return a *new* Relation, or should we make them modify / mutate the relation it is called on?"
79,91,posted_in_channel,"How do I know which node to start my traversal at in the reversed graph? Does it matter? I feel like I remember learning that the node you start at doesn't matter but I don't remember why 😅

Also, if there is a node that depends on a relation that is not produced by rules, then it doesn't matter what order we evaluate it in right?"
79,189,replied_to,It's an 'AND'
79,105,posted_in_channel,can somebody remind me what the symbols should be here? they are showing up as squares for me 😅

346,66,replied_to,I agree. All options for question 23 don't get the desired result. Performing Modus Tollens on 1 & 3 should give you ~(p ^ q) but the new fact is ~(p v q). I assume the old answer on question 25 that was changed was correctly performing De Morgan's law the value that should be in 4. The changed answer to question 25 is now the result from performing De Morgan's law on ~(p v q) which is not a fact we should have in our knowledge base.
346,110,posted_in_channel,"On 10a for question 25, it should be not p or not q, but it has and instead, which messes with question 29 if it’s not right"
346,346,replied_to,"The original error is 4 should be not (p and q), which is correct in question 23 but when you get to question 25 you don’t see question 23, so he changed question 25 to match the error in step 4, which makes 25 wrong, and if you use the incorrect conclusion in 25 then you can’t get the correct answer for 29 either"
474,29,posted_in_channel,Quick question that doesn t matter at

474,78,posted_in_channel,Okay so has anyone else had issues with bucket 100 test 8? I'm getting tuples added to my relation that are different lengths and it's causing problems when I try and join them
476,78,posted_in_channel,"Since the database stores tuples in a set, the unique tuples added when I evaluate the rules are out of order (and thus won't pass the tests). Is there any good way to fix this problem? (the tuples are all correct, just in random spots)"

161,29,posted_in_channel,Quick question that doesn't matter at all:
161,431,posted_in_thread,It’s called a type hint. You can use them to make your program more explicit about how it works.
161,443,posted_in_thread,You’re totally right. If your program gives more output after an `UNDEFINED` token it will fail the tests.
161,42,posted_in_thread,I also had to do something similar to guarantee imports. I think I ended up going explicitly from the parent `project1_classes` module.
161,110,posted_in_channel,I hope so! That’s how I’ve done everything.

63,66,replied_to,You do not need to submit anything on learning suite
63,29,posted_in_channel,"Just had a question regarding code style in the Jupyter Notebooks for Project 1 and how we should write our own code. In the state functions s0, s1, etc., it declares a variable ""next_state"" and then specifies with "":"" that is is a function.

63,58,posted_in_channel,should our rename method in the Relation class throw an error when we try renaming a different amount of headers than there are in our original Relation object? If that makes sense
63,78,posted_in_channel,"I just wanted to make sure I'm on the right track in understanding the interpret_rules fixed point algorithm:
- we iterate through the rule list in our datalog program and run them through our evaluate_rule function

- when the number returned is 0, we move on to the next rule until each one has been run through evaluate_rule with no change in the number returned."
63,490,posted_in_thread,so we call evaluate_rule on each rule until running all of them in a row results in 0 change for each one?

435,47,posted_in_channel,You have to make changes to the branch before you can make a pull request. Hit the new branch button and then go to that branch and add a readme file or make a slight change on github. Then you should be able to have an option that lets you make the pull request. That's what I did anyway and it worked for me

441,29,posted_in_channel,Quick Question regarding Project 1: I cloned the project before the pass-off tests were changed. I saw that a commit was made to my repo that presumable contains the changes needed for the new pass-offs. Can I just pull the changes or do I need to generate a new repo entirely?
441,101,replied_to,"I ended up splitting it up line by line, but just iterated over all the characters and the FSA would determine how many characters to erase from the line when a token was detected.

Like here is an example:

::-(:):

The first token that would be detected is "":"", I modified the FSA to count the number of characters the token is made out of. Once a token has been returned by the FSA manager, I add it to the token list then continue on with the rest of the line (erasing the number of characters that made up the previous token)

:-(:):

Then I run this through, which gets detected as the "":-"" token, this has a length of two, so I erase the next two characters. 

(:):

Pass it through, repeat the same process, until the line has no more characters, then I move onto the next line, repeat the process from the beginning again, and run through the entire file until it all works out.

How I got the length of the repeated token, is everytime it passed through any FSA it would count the number of times it moved from a different state. like for "";-"", it would say 'okay I found : add one to the number of characters to erase"" and so on. Couldn't figure out any other way to determine the length of the token other than this as some tokens are dynamic in nature and can't be precalculated.

This would also work if you just went over the entire file like this, instead of line by line. Just my two cents"

441,291,posted_in_thread,"Which is why I figured it would be best to take the lexed characters off of the beginning of the input then keep running it over and over till everything has been read, but I can't think of an easy way to determin how many characters formed the token"

441,507,posted_in_thread,"You will need to do two traversals, and they both will use different data structures. For your first traversal, all you need is postorder, so a list of ints will do (I recommend recursion for keeping track of your stack). Since the second traversal is only to find the SCC's, you will only need one data structure to store that. A list of lists of ints worked well for me (although a list of sets of ints would also do the job). Each tree in your forest represents one SCC so one list or set of ints within your larger list would represent one tree or SCC. The overall list represents the forest, so a list of trees or SCC's which needs to be ordered, as the first tree traversed represents the sink SCC which should be evaluated first, and so forth. Let me know if I answered your question or if you're still confused"

66,163,replied_to,That means wherever you're trying to run it you need to add a parameter. For example if you tried something like add_fsa.run() it wouldn't work because you have to pass a string to your FSAs. To fix it you can add something inside the parenthesis like add_fsa.run(input_string}

It should only take one iteration to print out all the resulting facts. I'll never need to run through that twice. BUT the answer output says there are two passes. It also includes a second line that repeats the rule.to_string function, something we shouldn't need as there are no new facts and should only appear if we ran throug the function again. This problem is repeated several times in input 6 and later inputs aswell. Also bucket 100 is ridiculously hard to test.

Hey everyone, the Daily Universe is working on a story covering the gaming habits of BYU Students! The idea behind the story is to show the campus and those involved with it just how big gaming is (since it seems many in the top brass don't realize it or choose not to). 

As a part of that, the DU has put together a simple survey (it's not super all-encompassing, just some basics) to help gather data for the story! It doesn't collect any personal info, either, just aggregate data. It would mean a lot if you all could fill it out and even share it with anyone else you can outside the club (ward chats, classes, etc.) so that we can get the best representation of BYU and really bring light to the impact and scale of gaming on campus!

101,29,posted_in_channel,"I ended up splitting it up line by line, but just iterated over all the characters and the FSA would determine how many characters to erase from the line when a token was detected.

Like here is an example:

::-(:):

The first token that would be detected is "":"", I modified the FSA to count the number of characters the token is made out of. Once a token has been returned by the FSA manager, I add it to the token list then continue on with the rest of the line (erasing the number of characters that made up the previous token)

:-(:):

Then I run this through, which gets detected as the "":-"" token, this has a length of two, so I erase the next two characters. 

(:):

Pass it through, repeat the same process, until the line has no more characters, then I move onto the next line, repeat the process from the beginning again, and run through the entire file until it all works out.

How I got the length of the repeated token, is everytime it passed through any FSA it would count the number of times it moved from a different state. like for "";-"", it would say 'okay I found : add one to the number of characters to erase"" and so on. Couldn't figure out any other way to determine the length of the token other than this as some tokens are dynamic in nature and can't be precalculated.

This would also work if you just went over the entire file like this, instead of line by line. Just my two cents"
101,36,posted_in_thread,"Defintely right about the \n

Yeah you are most likely right about it technically not being an FSA but a more dynamic system. I took some liberties to make it easier to deal with, so my advice may not necessarily be recommended.

Another possible, but more difficult way to implement this could be keep track of the characters you are looping through outside of the FSA's. 

You could possibly implement a system that finds one token, and then while looping through the rest of the characters finds the next valid token outside of a STRING and COMMENT token (keeping track of the position where the last token was found to where the next token was found) . Then you can accurately determine the length of the previous token value. 

Would I personally attempt this? No, sounds like a headache. But just another approach XD"
101,47,posted_in_channel,"so I am getting started on the project and I am wondering if I am doing this right? I am starting to write the parse_scheme and this is what I have. It looks horrible, any thoughts?

def parse_scheme(self):

            self.advance()
            if(self.match(""LEFT_PAREN"")):
                self.advance()
                if(self.match(""ID"")):
                    self.advance()
                    self.parse_idList()
                    if(self.match(""RIGHT_PAREN"")):
                        ...
```

For anyone having the same issue, please watch the TA help video. self.match() function can handle the error handling as well as the advancing. so it just becomes

```python
def parse_scheme(self):
        self.match(""ID"")
        self.match(""LEFT_PAREN"")
        self.match(""ID"")
