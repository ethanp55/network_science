1. The redirection sends stdout to point to the same file descriptor as stderr. Which in this case is the terminal.

       The  default  signal  for kill is TERM.  Use -l or -L to list available
       signals.  Particularly useful signals include  HUP,  INT,  KILL,  STOP,
       CONT,  and  0.   Alternate  signals may be specified in three ways: -9,
       -SIGKILL or -KILL.  Negative PID values may be  used  to  choose  whole
       process  groups; see the PGID column in ps command output.  A PID of -1
       is special; it indicates all processes except the kill  process  itself
       and init.

As far as file descriptors are concerned, remeber that when you fork a process you inherit the filedescriptors of your parent. This takes care of the sdtin, stdout, and stderr fd. You can then open the new files, redirect them as needed (using dup2).

Anyone can apply! I assume you have all taken 240 to be in this class, or else are taking it right now. If you have taken 240 you know enough to apply; there are even a few in the current cohort who got in without taking 240.

- `-p pid1,pid2` works because there is no space between them which is what delineates a new token
- `-p pid1 -p pid2` works because you have one input per one option because you repeat -p for each new input

It doesn't mean that calling close itself will throw the error; it means you call close and then the error is thrown later when trying to access that fd. There are other ways that you could get a `bad file descriptor` error but that's by far the most common one for this lab.

A common reason for this to occur is that you have multiple child processes running that are referencing the same fds, and you close them in the wrong order/at the wrong time. This is very easy to do and one of the most common mistakes in this lab. I would recommend writing out a diagram of the logical flow of your code (ie start with the parent, then show when the children are created and what they inherit, redraw the fds when you dup2 them, cross off the fds as you close them, etc). Make extra sure that you know which sections of code each process is accessing (what is for the parents or the children, is it only for some children or all children, etc).",posted_in_thread

This is one of the review questions. It was mentioned that for small programs like this we can assume that since STDOUT is buffered it's going to output at the end of the program, so STDERR then STDOUT. However, the internet also seems to be saying that the buffer will flush whenever it encounters a \n and when I tested this STDOUT ran first.

Is there something that I'm misunderstanding here?",posted_in_channel

For our sample program, if stdout and stderr are both redirected to a file, stderr output will occur first since it is unbuffered. For small programs, I believe the stdout data will be buffered and written to the file when the file is closed.

For the sample program, if both are written to the console, then stdout will occur first for the reason you mentioned - when a /n is encountered the data is output to the console. 

I tested the following change inspired by your question by removing the \n from the stdout string. In this case, with no i/o redirection, the stderr output was printed to the screen first.

- Make sure you run the Makefile in the `www/cgi-bin/` directory, otherwise the automated tests will not work and you can't do manual local testing.

- Several of the `curl`/`slow_client` commands given in the README specs **should fail**, meaning that it is impossible to connect to them. They should only be used to confirm if you are correctly reading and parsing the client request. If you want to test if you can connect to and read a response from a server, please check the links under **Checkpoint 5**.

- When reading a request from the client, you need to read until you receive the end-of-headers sequence, i.e. `\r\n\r\n`

- When reading a response from the server, you need to read until `recv()` returns 0",posted_in_channel

Slightly longer answer with a little more explanation: When we initialized `buf` at the beginning of question 27, we set it to size `BUFSIZE` (which is 30). Then, all 30 characters are set to `z`. Most of `buf`'s characters gradually get replaced with the characters from test.txt. But, there are less than 30 characters in test.txt, which means there will be some z's left over after test.txt has been completely parsed.

(problem 31 is one example where it askes us to run stat on a file but when I ran it on the c file the answer was wrong, I wasnt sure what it wanted it used on) 2)Many questions stack off the last questions output, which can create problems if you made a mistake earlier, we have no examples of good outputs so we can only be sure we made a mistake if theres an error or we lose points when we answer a question. Dividing into more subsections would help prevent butterfly failure. 3) we had pages of reading, command descriptions, and sub problem instructions on top of coding, some of the required readings felt unneccissary and other specs I had to find myself to keep up with all the new commands. 4) Divide the sub assignments up, the instructions are in 3 or 4 different files from the github, with problem numbers that overlap, it creates confusion and prevents students from being sure their old answers are correct before working on later ones (it'd also make correcting our errors easier since we wouldnt have to reupload all our answers and explanations each time which slows things down).",posted_in_thread
